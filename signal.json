Here is her story. Her son\u2019s follows below. \n\nWhen I was diagnosed with the disease, the kids were small. My doctor said I had 10 years to live and I lasted 12 before getting the transplant. As a mother, I thought I\u2019d never see my kids grow up. \n\nPSC (primary sclerosing cholangitis) progresses slowly, but the past two years were not good. I deteriorated very rapidly. The bile ducts close up due to inflammation and the bile seeps into the liver and destroys the liver cells, and as a doctor explained to me, you digest yourself. You get high fever, lots of pain and you get confused in the end. I was yellow and green. I lost, I think, 20 kilograms in a very short time. \n\nA liver donation is not an easy thing to decide on. I asked my boys to go on Facebook to look for living donors for me. A nurse had asked, \u201cWhat about your children?\u201d And I said, \u201cHow can I do that?\u201d She said, \u201cWell, the child doesn\u2019t want to lose the parent; the parent doesn\u2019t want to lose the child.\u201d And that\u2019s true. \n\nBut I didn\u2019t ask them to sign up to get tested; I wouldn\u2019t. And anyway, that\u2019s coercion too because then they\u2019d feel guilty if they said no. But my oldest one, Phillip, he signed up to be a donor right away and Martin too. \n\nWhen I thought about what they might have to go through, I felt terrible. It\u2019s your own son and you\u2019re worried there\u2019s a chance you might lose him. But when they rejected Phillip as a match, I was devastated. I was suicidal. Because Martin was so young, I didn\u2019t even think he would be accepted. \n\nIn the end, I think you cling to life. The will to live is there and it pulls you through. \n\nAfter the surgery, I went in to see Martin and I held his hand. \u201cMy Martin,\u201d I said to him. \u201cI won\u2019t forget. \n\n\u201d \n\nHe has no pain tolerance, and I didn\u2019t realize that. So he was just using the hand-held pump to pump morphine into himself. I felt guilty that he did that for me. \n\nSince I was so ill before, my liver was so shot, after getting 60 per cent of a healthy liver, I felt fine. I mean, I felt pain, but my pain tolerance is pretty high. So I felt guilty that I felt so good and he felt so awful. It\u2019s a guilt that doesn\u2019t really go away. You carry that with you. There\u2019s a fear that something might happen down the road with him. So I think I understand why people do anonymous donations. \n\nI also feel sorry Martin lost his gallbladder; they had to remove it during surgery. That really struck me. I knew the liver would regrow, but he\u2019s so young. I haven\u2019t told him, but I keep watching what he eats. \n\nThere\u2019s no sign he has any digestive issues, but I\u2019m always looking him in the eyes to make sure they\u2019re not turning yellow. His whole life is ahead of him. If I keep talking about this, I\u2019m going to start crying. \n\nHealth wise, I feel like I can do stuff now that I couldn\u2019t do for years. I have to take pills for life, and that\u2019s fine. The medication I take now, they cause kidney failure eventually, so I don\u2019t drink. I have side effects from the pills, but I\u2019m learning to accept them. \n\nI feel honoured that they did it. Both of them. Now with Martin giving me the liver, it\u2019s brought us even closer together. \n\nMartin Hinrichs-Pymm, 19, is studying voice performance at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Ont. Here is his story. \n\nThe doctors had told me, \u201cYou\u2019re going to feel like you\u2019re hit by a train. You\u2019re not going to see what\u2019s coming.\u201d They were so right. It was just painful. I didn\u2019t realize it. I had no clue what I was in for. The moment I woke up after the surgery, I couldn\u2019t wish it on another human being, on my worst enemy. \n\nIf someone had asked me at that point, I\u2019d say \u201cDon\u2019t do it. Don\u2019t do the transplant.\u201d I kept thinking, \u201cWhy did I do this? Oh my God.\u201d I felt so horrible. And I was so paranoid of everything. I thought they were giving me placebos instead of pain medication because I couldn\u2019t sleep. I was a mess. \n\nI thought, personally, I\u2019d be up walking in three days. It took two weeks before I could even walk like a man in his 80s. It was like learning to walk all over again because you\u2019re stumbling and you\u2019re weak, and you\u2019re trying to get your balance. \n\nIn the hospital, I kept asking the doctors, \u201cWhen is it going to end? Like, give me a day. An hour. What time is this pain going to stop? \n\n\u201d \n\nAnd they\u2019d be like, \u201cWell, it\u2019s different for everybody.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cNo. Answer the question!\u201d But of course, they really don\u2019t know. They said, \u201cOh, maybe in four or three days \u2026\u201d And that was even worse. What do you mean four or three? Which one? \n\nIt took me three days to have a bowel movement, which I was really impressed with. It sounds gross.

The best car seat, experts say, is the one that best fits your child and your\u2026 \r \nAs parents adjust to New Jersey's new, tougher child car seat law that took effect Sept. 1, new research is showing that they have more to worry about than just having kids in the appropriate seats. \n\nAccording to a study to be published next month, a team of academic, automotive and child restraint seat experts found that in dozens of tests, child restraint seats simply did not fit properly in the car. \n\nAn improper fit, the forthcoming study says, could have \"serious consequences\" for the child in an accident if the seat is jostled or if a child is pitched forward in a seat sitting at an improper angle. \n\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, child restraint seats should be secured with a seat belt with less than an inch of movement along the seat belt, on a level plane and supported by at least 80 percent of the vehicle's seat. \n\nBut adults often fail at installing safety seats properly, NHTSA says. A 2009 NHTSA report found that 95 percent of adults failed to properly secure an infant car seat using the anchor-and-tether system common to child restraint seats. \n\nThe conflict between safer car seats and automotive design is growing, according to Dr. Aditya Belwadi, a research scientist for biomechanics research at the Center for Injury Research and Prevention at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \n\n\"With all these new safety regulations coming in... cars are getting smaller and smaller while car seats are getting bigger and bigger,\" said Belwadi, whose center funded the study. \"This is a constant battle between how do you draw the line between what's good for safety and what's good for comfort.\" \n\nMORE: New Jersey's new car seat law \u2013 5 mistakes to avoid \n\nFor the study, researchers observed 59 child restraint seats and 61 late-model vehicles, said Julie Bing, a research engineer in the Injury Biomechanics Research Center at Ohio State University. Looking at several key measurements for fit, the researchers compiled 3,600 points of car seat-vehicle combinations. \n\nAccording to the study, to be published in October in the journal Traffic Injury Prevention, nearly 42 percent of rear-facing child restraint seats will not sit at the proper angle on the vehicle's seat pan. \n\nSome rear-facing safety seats can be adjusted to change the angle at which the baby is reclining, Bing said, but not all are adjustable. \n\nA rear-facing child restraint seat pitched at too sharp an angle could put the child at risk for breathing obstruction, the study said. \n\nIn some cases, parents can stuff a rolled-up beach towel, blanket or even a section of a pool noodle into the back of the seat base to level the child's seat, she said. \n\n\"It's perfectly safe to do and recommended if you can get a tight fit,\" Bing said. \n\nThe study also says that in more than a third of all automobile-child safety seat combinations, the base of the child restraint seat will be too wide to properly fit between the car seats' sides, or bolsters. \n\nHead restraints for vehicles' rear seats also caused problems in establishing a snug fit with front-facing child restraint seats in about 33 percent of the combinations, the study said. \n\nSome cars allow o\u2026","title":"Child car seats often don't fit cars properly, study says","media-type":"News","source":"MyInforms","published":"2015-09-09T11:39:01Z"}

Is there anything available that will help me to remove the buildup? It is REALLY BAD! I read your mold-removal technique, and I have bleach and tea-tree oil at home, and I plan on trying that first. Another question: Can I use them together? \n\nWhen this question arrived in my inbox, I immediately OOFed at the situation this poor lady found herself in\u2014somehow, the fact that it was a friend who\u2019d made such a horrible mess of her bathroom upped the level of nastiness. And then, a few days later, my husband was emailed a photo that caused him to let out a high-pitched \u201cEEEEEEWWWWWWW\u201d and hold his phone away from him, as if the pic itself might cause an infection of the eyes. When I asked what was so awful, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think you can see this. It might actually cause you to die. \n\n\u201d \n\nHere\u2019s what happened: A mutual friend of ours was helping a couple we all know move out of their apartment. He snapped a photo of their empty bathroom, which had apparently not ever been cleaned in several years. It was a horror show. \n\nThe tub was the color of old butter. It sort of looked like maybe it had been spread with old butter, in fact. The shower walls were covered in mold, mildew, and a layer of soap scum so thick that it was clearly visible even in the crappy camera-phone photo. It was so vile, oh my God. \n\nAnd so, given these two events, I figured that while I\u2019ve covered bathroom-cleaning in this space before, it was still worth putting together a more comprehensive post on what to do when confronted with a truly nasty sitch. Let\u2019s start by reviewing the existing literature. \n\nThe Literature \n\nThese posts tend to address one very specific subject, though some are broader than others. \n\nTools \n\nPart of the reason I was excited to take this question on is that I realized that, while I\u2019ve spent a lot of time talking to you about what products to use when it comes to getting your bathroom clean and lovely, I\u2019ve not dedicated a lot of space to some of the tools that can really help the process along. \n\nI do, however, often mention rubber gloves. I\u2019m doing so again: When working with the kinds of cleaning products that we\u2019re going to talk about today, you absolutely must wear protective gloves. Opening the window is also really important\u2014fumes, you see. The thing is that the gloves serve another purpose in that they keep your flesh from having to make contact with the nastiness you\u2019re trying to clean. Don\u2019t underestimate that! The gloves make things so much more humane. \n\nBecause we\u2019re talking about shower walls and a tub that have developed a fairly thick buildup, some sloughing power will also greatly help matters. A scrub brush will let you scour walls and grout; my old pal the Dobie Pad is another great option, especially if your shower is fiberglass, as it scours without causing scratching; for straight tile or porcelain, a Scotch-Brite Scouring Pad will also go a long way in scrubbing scum away. \n\nFinally, get yourself a squeegee. This Cleret number comes highly rated on Amazon and is under $15, so it won\u2019t break the bank. The squeegee is going to help you to get your shower walls\u2014and, if you have them, your glass shower doors\u2014extra spotless-looking. The squeegee will help if you also notice that the bathroom walls are nasty; use an all-purpose spray cleaner in concert with the squeegee to easily wipe away aerosol-effect buildup. They\u2019re also helpful when it comes to doing the final rinsing-away of all those caustic cleaning products I\u2019m about to tell you to use. \n\nProducts \n\nPut the tea-tree oil down. That stuff is pricey, and it isn\u2019t going to be powerful enough to touch the mess your tenant-friend left behind for you to clean up. To answer your question, though, yes, you can mix bleach and tea-tree oil. But don\u2019t: There\u2019s no reason to do so. The deal with tea-tree oil is that it\u2019s a natural alternative to bleach. If you\u2019re down with using bleach, then there\u2019s no reason to bother with the expensive and weaker alternative. \n\nBut I actually don\u2019t want you to use bleach, either. Bleach is fine. But I actually recommend something gnarlier. \n\nGuys, I love this X-14 stuff so much. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s made of (and I don\u2019t actually really want to know), but oh, man, it works so well. I\u2019m not the only one who feels this way either! I mean, look at these Amazon reviews \n\n. \n\nBut it\u2019s nice to have choices in life, so as much as I want you to share in my love of X-14, there are certainly other options. One product that gets similarly high marks from Amazon users is Zep No-Scrub Mold and Mildew Stain Remover. I haven\u2019t used this particular offering from Zep, but I have used other products, and they are quite good\u2014and quite heavy-duty. So I feel perfectly confident in recommending this to you. \n\nThe last product to mention\u2014though I want to note that there are many, many good cleaning products out there that I\u2019m not including, because otherwise we\u2019d be here all day\u2014is the Magic Eraser. Now, the Magic Eraser is not a thing you\u2019re going to use for any of your heavy-duty cleaning; rather, it\u2019s what you should get if, after all the scrubbing and squeegee-ing and inhaling of fumes, there is minor staining left behind. The Magic Eraser will be the ticket for those little discolored spots. \n\nThe Soap-Scum Trick \n\nSoap scum is different from mold and mildew. In its way, it\u2019s worse\u2014I find it way more stubborn to remove than its furry green friends. But I have a trick! (Of course I do.) I\u2019ve shared this before, but I feel like I\u2019ve always sort of buried it, and it deserves a place in the sun because it\u2019s so weird and it works so well: Grab a dryer sheet, get it wet, and use it to scrub scummy glass, tile, or fiberglass walls and tub interiors. It\u2019s SO BIZARRE. But it totally works.

Golf has always been more than a sport, it is a life code, an arena where manners matter, where the opponent is held in higher regard than ourselves. Or at least that is how I understood it until Suzann Pettersen took a Costa-like clever to the integrity of the spo\u2026 \r \nThe French philosopher, novelist and goalkeeper with African Cup winners Racing Universitaire d\u2019Alger, Albert Camus, said this of football. \u201cAfter many years during which I saw many things, what I know most surely about morality and the duty of man I owe to sport and learned it in the RUA.\u201d Camus would be tearing up his season ticket were he a Chelsea fan after the twin attack on the game\u2019s moral fibre by Costa and his puerile apologist Jose Mourinho. \n\nThe idea that Costa plays the game in the \u2018right\u2019 way, as asserted by Mourinho, is anathema to the Corinthian values underpinning worthwhile competition, and to the teachings of every club coach dishing out bibs in junior football. As a former under eight coach myself I have no recollection of anyone in the Milton Keynes Junior League instructing a player to win by all means necessary, to pull a shirt, to elbow a cheekbone, to slap a face, to spit in the eye of civility. \n\nCamus was expressing the sentiment that in its highest form sport shapes people as much as it develops players. Without respect, dignity and manners there is nowt worth having. This is particularly so in golf, a game that prides itself on its self-policing protocols, that gains it\u2019s authority from a commitment to doing the right thing. In golf victory is not worth the having if to gain it you have to cough during your opponent\u2019s backswing. \n\nCosta would saw your putter in half if the caddie wasn\u2019t looking, leaving you to putt with a wedge on the greens. Into this murky world of performance advantage strides Pettersen, who used the rules of the game at St Leon-Rot Golf Club to gain an advantage she would never have had. And it stunk the place out. \n\nAlison Lee\u2019s putt to win the 17th hole, and go one up in the crucial fourball held over from Saturday night, missed by 18 inches. She could have tapped it in with a knitting needle. Pettersen, who was already off the green, would never have asked her to putt in a month of Sundays, yet claimed she would. \n\nPettersen\u2019s playing partner, Charley Hull, turned on her heels conveying in her bold stride that the action was done and the hole halved. Crucially, neither player formally conceded. Lee claims she heard the words \u201cthat\u2019s good\u201d and scooped up her ball. She turned to walk to the 18th tee but instead walked into a wall of Pettersen inspired gamesmanship. \n\nOnce Pettersen insisted that she would have made Lee putt, Hull was left in no choice but to support her team-mate, though her tears on the 18th green at the conclusion of the match told another story. The hole was awarded to Europe and the point was duly gained at the last, which the Americans conceded to Europe after both Lee\u2019s and Brittany Lincicome\u2019s birdie putts missed. \n\nThe point gained meant Europe took a four-point advantage into the singles needing only four more to retain the Solheim Cup.

(Photo: Michael Chow\/azcentral sports) \n\nThe Cardinals have a pair of homecomings in 2015. They visit Chicago and St. Louis, cities that once housed and cheered for our football team. \n\nDon\u2019t expect much in the way of sentiment. \n\nThe Big Red is mostly a faded memory in the Windy City, but this year, a library in suburban Orland Park is hosting an exhibit dedicated to the Chicago Cardinals. It features rare artifacts and documents, and one former fan sent along a reminder of their once-heated rivalry with the Bears. \n\nAfter weeks of arguing over where a 1922 game would played, the two teams settled on Comiskey Park. During the contest, Cardinals star Paddy Driscoll strongly objected to a gang tackle from the Bears\u2019 George Halas and Joey Sternaman. He got off the ground and started throwing punches. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when the thugs came out,\u201d Halas wrote in his autobiography. \u201cSo did reserve players. So did fans from both stands. The police came out, too, wielding sticks and blowing whistles and shouting. \n\n\u201d \n\nBears tackle Ed Healey was quoted thusly: \n\n\u201cYou had the Al Capone crowd \u2026 so here came that bunch of South side rooters, flowing out from the bench with their (guns) out. They were going out there to protect their idol, Paddy Driscoll. I stood there in amazement. Here I am playing on this field for one hundred bucks, and my God, they want to kill me \n\n!\u201d \n\nAnd you thought things were rough at the 49ers\u2019 stadium. \n\nThe Cardinals and Bears have recent history. Their first meeting at University of Phoenix Stadium led to Denny Green\u2019s epic podium meltdown. Anquan Boldin went bonkers before their last meeting at Soldier Field in November 2009, after discovering that Ken Whisenhunt had placed him on the inactive list. \n\nMost recently, the Bears whiffed on a chance to hire Bruce Arians, botching the interview process by asking the NFL\u2019s Coach of the Year to keep the incumbent defensive coordinator, and requesting that he perform a mock press conference for their perusal. \n\nArians was surely rolling his eyes when he left the building, and the Bears settled on Marc Trestman, a disastrous maneuver. \n\nYet the Arians story has been muted in Chicago by the hiring of head coach John Fox, a consummate professional who has already changed the mood among the Bears\u2019 rabid fan base. So there\u2019s really not much in the way of grudges, and for the most part, this is just another road game for the Cardinals. With one notable exception: \n\nTo win the NFC West, the Cardinals likely need to win at least three road games. This is one of the easiest on the schedule, along with a trip to Cleveland on Halloween weekend. These Bears do not have a ferocious defense. They have an erratic quarterback. And if you\u2019re a warm-weather opponent, September is the perfect time to play a football game on the shores of Lake Michigan. \n\nTheir biggest challenge will be handling Bears\u2019 dual-threat running back Matt Forte, especially after the Saints tore up the Cardinals defense with a series of screen and swing passes in Week 1. That surely has been a point of emphasis during this week\u2019s practice. \n\nThe key to winning road games is an elite quarterback, and there no longer seems to be doubts surrounding Carson Palmer, who is 14-2 in his last 16 starts. He hasn\u2019t lost a game since the 2013 season. He has developed a mastery of Arians\u2019 offense, s\u2026","title":"Bickley: Palmer key to Cardinals success on road","media-type":"News","source":"MyInforms","published":"2015-09-18T17:46:48Z"}

Somehow poor old Ice became a slightly ridiculous figure, probably not helped by an eight-month relationship with Madonna that year, which lead to him appearing scantily clad in her notorious book, Sex. \n\nAnd if all this is making you give up the will to live, check out the nation's favourite funeral songs. \n\nAnita Ward: Ring My Bell \n\nThis 1979 disco classic is still rememberd for its wailing chorus and accompanying bell dings but it was Memphis-born Anita's only hit. \n\nChesney Hawkes: The One and Only \n\nAn unfortunate title if ever there was one... \n\nChesney topped the UK Singles Chart in 1991 and hit the Top 10 in the US.

{"id":"9a7bade4-2c0b-4818-ae77-3179bbac609f","content":"The following post first appeared on FactCheck.org. Hillary Clinton directly addressed questions in recent interviews about her exclusive use of a personal email account and server to conduct government business as secretary of state. But her answers only reveal part of the story:  Clinton said her personal email account was \u201callowed by the State Department.\u201d It was permitted if work emails were preserved. Federal rules required Clinton to preserve work emails before she\u2026 \r \nClinton said her personal email account was \u201callowed by the State Department.\u201d It was permitted if work emails were preserved. Federal rules required Clinton to preserve work emails before she left office, but she did not turn over her emails until 21 months after she left office. \n\nClinton said \u201cturning over my server\u201d to the government shows \u201cI have been as transparent as I could\u201d about her emails. But she did so in August after the FBI opened an investigation. In March, she rejected calls to turn over the server to a neutral party, saying \u201cthe server will remain private.\u201d \n\nClinton said \u201ceverybody in government with whom I emailed knew that I was using a personal email.\u201d But that ignores those \u2014 including President Obama \u2014 who did not know that she used it exclusively for government business. \n\nThe Democratic front-runner for her party\u2019s presidential nomination addressed the email controversy in interviews on Sept. 4 with MSNBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell and again on Sept. 7 with the Associated Press. The subject has been dogging Clinton ever since the New York Timesreported on March 2 that she exclusively used a personal email account and computer server to conduct official government business. The article also reported that, at the State Department\u2019s request, Clinton on Dec. 5, 2014, gave the department just over 30,000 printed copies of work-related emails. \n\nClinton previously addressed the email issue in her first national interview with CNN in early July, but a lot has happened since then. The inspector general of the intelligence community said her emails contained classified information and made a \u201csecurity referral\u201d to the Justice Department in late July. Clinton directed her campaign in mid-August to turn over her computer server to the FBI, which is now investigating. \n\nMitchell told MSNBC colleague Rachel Maddow that she believes she got the interview because the campaign needs to \u201creset\u201d on the issue. \u201cThe campaign needed to do a serious interview on the subject,\u201d Mitchell said. \n\nNational Archives, Oct. 2, 2009: Agencies that allow employees to send and receive official electronic mail messages using a system not operated by the agency must ensure that Federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system. \n\nAt a March 3 press briefing, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf also cited the 2009 NARA rule in saying Clinton apparently complied with the rules. \n\n\u201cAs I said, there\u2019s no prohibition on using this kind of email account as long as it\u2019s preserved,\u201d Harf said. \u201cShe has taken steps to preserve those records by providing the State Department with the 55,000 pages, so \u2013 I\u2019m not a NARA expert, but certainly, it sounds to me like that has been completed. \n\n\u201d \n\nHarf is admittedly no NARA expert, but Jason R. Baron is. \n\nBaron, a lawyer at Drinker Biddle and a former director of litigation at the National Archives,told the Senate Judiciary Committee in May that \u201cany employee\u2019s decision to conduct all e-mail correspondence through a private e-mail network, using a non-.gov address, is inconsistent with long-established policies and practices under the Federal Records Act and NARA regulations governing all federal agencies. \n\n\u201d \n\nAlso, as we have written, Clinton should have turned over her emails before she left office, but she didn\u2019t. \n\nNARA regulations require federal agencies to maintain an NARA-approved schedule for the disposition of federal records. The State Department Records Disposition Schedule says \u201cincoming and outgoing correspondence and memorandums on substantive U.S. foreign policy issues\u201d should be permanently retained \u201cat the end of the Secretary\u2019s tenure or sooner if necessary. \n\n\u201d \n\nClinton left office Feb. 1, 2013. She did not turn over her emails to the State Department until Dec. 5, 2014, and only after the department in October of that year requested the emails in part to respond to the congressional requests for documents related to the Benghazi attacks on Sept. 11, 2012. \n\nThe Clinton campaign has said that she complied with NARA regulations because \u201cmore than 90% of those emails should have already been captured in the State Department\u2019s email system before she provided them with paper copies. \n\n\u201d \n\nBut that assumes that the people receiving an email from Clinton properly preserved the record. Baron, the former director of litigation at NARA, told us for a previous story that Clinton \u201cbasically offloaded her burden to others\u201d to preserve her emails. He told us Clinton was out of compliance with the regulations the day she left office. \n\nOne last point: The Washington Post Fact Checker wrote that when she was secretary in June 2011 \u201ca cable went out under her signature warning employees to \u2018avoid conducting official Department business from your personal e-mail accounts. \n\n\u2019 \u201d \n\nThe Clinton campaign noted that that cable was sent after Google disclosed that the Gmail accounts of some government employees were being targeted by hackers originating in China \u2014 a situation Clinton described at the time as \u201cvery serious.\u201d The cable did not say that the advice was limited to those with Gmail accounts. Asked if the campaign was suggesting that it applied only to Gmail users, Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin said he was offering \u201cimportant context\u201d given that the department has said personal email use was permitted under certain circumstances. \n\nTransparency and Clinton\u2019s Server \n\nIn her interview with Mitchell, Clinton took responsibility for her decision to use a private email account. She also took some credit for being \u201cas transparent as I could\u201d in handling the email controversy. \n\nClinton, Sept. 4: I take responsibility. I should\u2019ve had two accounts \u2014 one for personal, one for work-related \u2014 and I\u2019ve been as transparent as I could, asking all 55,000 pages be released to the public, turning over my server, looking for opportunities to testify before Congress. I\u2019ve offered for nearly a year. \n\nIt\u2019s true that she asked the State Department to release her emails on March 5, but the request came three months after she gave the emails to the department and three days after the New York Times broke the story that she exclusively used a personal email system to conduct official business. \n\nAs for her server, Clinton initially rejected suggestions that she turn it over to an independent third-party. At a March 10 press conference, Clinton said all personal emails were deleted from her server, and she rejected the suggestion that she turn her server over to an \u201cindependent arbiter\u201d to prove that she did not destroy any work-related emails. \n\nClinton, March 10: The server contains personal communications from my husband and me, and I believe I have met all of my responsibilities and the server will remain private, and I think that the State Department will be able, over time, to release all of the records that were provided. \n\nFive months later, on Aug. 11, Clinton directed her legal team to turn over her email server\u2026","title":"Hillary Clinton's Email Explanation Only Reveals Part Of The Story","media-type":"News","source":"MyInforms","published":"2015-09-09T13:06:48Z"}

Prime Minister Viktor Orban's homeland security adviser told reporters that \"we will employ all legal means to protect Hungary's border's security.\" \n\n\"We will not permit violent, armed, aggressive attackers to enter,\" he added, backing up his statement with a claim that one of the more than 500 refugees who have been arrested under Hungary's strict new border-crossing laws was \"an identified terrorist.\" \n\nMigrants seek new route through Croatia \n\nNew statues aimed at clamping down at illegal entry into Hungary, used by many asylum seekers as a gateway to the Europe Union, came into force at midnight on Tuesday, forcing refugees to make their way to northern EU countries through Croatia. \n\nThe Croatian government, for its part, has pledged to allow asylum seekers free passage through its borders on their way to Germany and Scandinavia.

The remaining gas will then be compressed and shot back into the ground for possible future use. \n\nThe state, through tax incentives, has helped pay for much of the project. But the additional production will help a state facing multi-billion-dollar deficits amid low oil prices. \n\nConsidered \"new oil\" under the state's tax program, the production could receive generous tax breaks. The greatest benefit is expected to come from the state's royalty share, with Alaska owning more than 12.5 percent of the produced oil. \n\nExxonMobil called the arrival of the modules a \u201cmilestone\" in a press statement. The modules, including one more than half a football field long, were shipped on barges more than 4,000 miles from Korea. The Point Thomson field is located more than 600 miles northeast of Anchorage along the U.S. Arctic Ocean, near the South-Carolina-sized Arctic refuge. \n\nExxonMobil became the unit operator in the mid-1970s, but production has been elusive. The company long argued that cost, the immense pressure of the gas reservoir and a lack of access to a pipeline created obstacles to development. \n\nUpset, state officials terminated the unit almost a decade ago under Gov. Frank Murkowski, leading to a fight with ExxonMobil that went to the state Supreme Court. A 2012 settlement laid out a path toward production. \n\nTo date, the Houston, Texas-based oil giant said it and other \"working interest owners\" in the project have spent $3.2 billion. The new facilities include a 22-mile pipeline so the condensates can join the crude oil that pays most state bills. \n\nExxonMobil said about 70 percent of the investment has been spent in-state, with 99 Alaska companies involved in the project. More than 800 people are currently working at the site, with several hundred others also involved elsewhere in Alaska. \n\nThe new pipeline can handle up to 70,000 daily barrels of condensate liquid.

But if you look beyond the sweet counter (and instant gratification, for that matter) and consider making some items from scratch, there is a host of fun last\u2011minute nibbles to be made. \n\nWe often think we\u2019d be content to eat only snacks: an ever-rotating series of things on toast, small plates of deliciously cooked vegetables, dumplings dunked in a vinegary-chilli sauce, little deep-fried nibbles \u2026 we could go on. Maybe the novelty would wear off eventually, but there\u2019s a lot to be said for having some fun in the kitchen and treating dinner in your own home like a party every so often. This partly means eating things that aren\u2019t generally considered to make up a main, but also being resourceful in terms of the ingredients you use and the time you take to make something. \n\nRelated: Lunch recipes for your bento box | The lunch box \n\nPizza is surely one of the best party and snack foods known to man. Yes, you can eat a whole one to yourself, but it\u2019s so much more enjoyable to make a batch and share, so that each person gets to devour a couple of piping hot slices as soon as they\u2019re removed from the oven. \n\nSpeaking of ovens, you don\u2019t need a clay one to make this dream a reality. Nor do you need to craft your dough like an artisan baker. Cast authenticity to the wind, and (quite literally) throw together a dough from self-raising flour and yoghurt to make a flatbread-like base that\u2019s happy to host any number of toppings as the recipe hereafter explains. The yoghurt \u2013 an ingredient sometimes, though not always, added to Turkish flatbreads such as gozleme or bazlama \u2013 gives a slight tang to the dough, and produces a softer texture. The bacteria present in yoghurt create lactic acid, which acts as the fermenter here. \n\nTo top your pizza, you could make a simple tomato sauce, but if you\u2019re short on time, jarred pestos and those small, intensely flavoured aubergine and tomato pasta sauces work a treat. Then, simply pop on your favourite toppings: feta, mozzarella, spinach, anchovies, capers, jarred artichokes (maybe not all together but, you know, mix and match) \u2026 the cornershop or storecupboard is your oyster. \n\nWe realise that in this, the #cleaneating apogee, a recipe involving the act of deep-frying may land us in untrendy hot water. However, naughty but nice is okay, sometimes. And never more so than in the case of the most joyous and substantial of snacks: the oft-purchased but less oft-homemade, not-so-humble (Fortnum and Mason invented it, yah) scotch egg. \n\nPurists, look away. Though we have yet to find a worthy substitute for the internal egg (just kidding, even we wouldn\u2019t go there) we don\u2019t think sausage meat or breadcrumbs are essential. A breadcrumb crisis led us to the discovery that Rice Krispies make an excellent crispy coating alternative \u2013 crushed cornflakes would work well too \u2013 and using mashed canned beans and herbs instead of pork saves you a trip to the butcher, as well as some pennies. There are all sorts of alternatives to be tried: curried boiled potatoes with cumin and mustard seeds; mashed kidney beans with smoked paprika and finely chopped and cooked red onion. Mix it up and make a stuffing according to what you have readily available, then turn on the extractor and fry away. \n\nThe moment you cut your scotch egg in half is a happy one, if all has gone well, you will gingerly reveal half an orangey orb of joy. Resist shoving it in your mouth immediately and instead, plate them up halved with some green salad and piccalilli on the side for a touch of class. \n\nDon\u2019t forget to add any leftovers lurking in your fridge to your pizza topping.

They concluded that the material had originally been given the U.S. government\u2019s highest secrecy classification. Even if one of Clinton\u2019s aides stripped the markings (a felony), Secretary Clinton surely knew satellite intelligence and North Korean nuclear deployments are the U.S. government\u2019s most highly classified information. \n\nThe media correctly saw the news as political trouble for Hillary, but they missed two other crucial elements of the story. Somebody high up in the intelligence community leaked that story. And Hillary faces far more than political trouble. She\u2019s being fitted for an orange jumpsuit. \n\nThe NYT story came from anonymous sources. For Camp Clinton, the most ominous words are \u201csenior intelligence officials said.\u201d They signal just how furious the intelligence community is at the gross mishandling of their crown jewels. Since the intelligence agencies must now sort through everything Hillary has given to the State Department, plus whatever the FBI can scrape from the server, you can expect the leaks to keep on coming. Worse yet for her, the spy agencies must conduct a full-scale damage assessment, based on the high likelihood her server was hacked by foreign governments (and perhaps some 17-year-old in his parents\u2019 basement in Belgrade). \n\nThe intelligence services remember how seriously the Department of Justice dealt with former CIA directors John Deutsch and David Petraeus, who mishandled documents. They will demand equal treatment here. They will keep the heat on by leaking to the press. The Times story shows the faucet is already open. \n\nHillary\u2019s legal problems stem from the \u201cgross mishandling\u201d of security information, which is a serious crime. It doesn\u2019t matter whether the materials are stamped or not. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you intended to violate the law or not. It is a violation simply to put them anywhere that lacks adequate safeguards. Like a private server. Nobody stamped Gen. Petraeus\u2019 personal calendar, which he kept in an unlocked drawer at home. John Deutsch was just trying to catch up on work by taking his CIA laptop home. Those mistakes are trivial compared with what Clinton is already known to have stored on her private server in Chappaqua. \n\nIt\u2019s just hand waving to keep saying the documents were not stamped. Satellite intelligence is always classified. So are private diplomatic discussions with foreign officials. They are born that way. Secretary Clinton is expected to know that, and she has said she was well aware of the classification rules. The straightforward conclusion is that she repeatedly violated laws for handling of national security materials. \n\nAs the investigation proceeds, Secretary Clinton should also be wondering how loyal her aides are. So far, they have marched in a solid phalanx with her. But whoever removed the classification markings on incoming satellite data faces years in jail. The FBI will be in a strong position to encourage them to speak \u201cfully and frankly,\u201d as they say in the State Department. \n\nValuable as the New York Times story is, it also misses a third crucial element. Although it highlights Hillary\u2019s private email, it glosses over her private server. Reluctantly, she has begun to answer questions about the email account and even issued a limp apology. But she never mentions the server. When Fox\u2019s Ed Henry asked her if she knew of any other government officials who had one, she refused to answer. \n\nWhy would a public official go to the time, trouble and expense of setting up a private server and paying her own IT people to run it? Simple: to keep the contents under her contr\u2026","title":"\"Senior Intelligence Officials Said\"","media-type":"News","source":"MyInforms","published":"2015-09-09T18:26:14Z"}

With many on Wall Street thinking that a rate increase has been pushed to December, and the Chinese currency devaluation and slow-down now largely priced in, this could be the time to add solid growth stocks to an aggressive portfolio. \n\nIn a recent research report, Jefferies has some top growth stock calls that the firm feels have outstanding upside potential for fall trading. We screened the stocks for those that are the \u201cless-crowded\u201d trades on Wall Street. \n\nThis company pioneered the artificial heart valve and could be poised for big growth. Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (NYSE: EW) provides products and technologies to treat structural heart disease and critically ill patients worldwide. The company offers transcatheter heart valve therapy products comprising transcatheter aortic heart valves and their delivery systems for the nonsurgical replacement of heart valves. The company also provides surgical heart valve therapy products, such as pericardial valves for aortic and mitral replacement and minimally invasive aortic heart valve systems, as well as tissue heart valves and repair products, which are used to replace or repair a patient\u2019s diseased or defective heart valve. \n\nThe Jefferies team thinks that the company\u2019s acquisition of privately held CardiAQ makes good sense going forward. CardiAQ has human implants of transcatheter mitrial valves, and Edwards is focused on the mitrial valve opportunity after their very strong success in aortic valves. The company also has had tremendous success with transcatheter valve replacement. Transcatheter heart valve replacements are rapidly gaining favor in the medical community for use in those patients who are deemed unsuited for open heart surgery, and they are a fast-growing revenue stream for the company. \n\nThe Jefferies price target for the stock, which is only up 3% this year, is $180. The Thomson\/First Call consensus price target is $171.40. The stock closed Tuesday at $139.68. \n\nMasterCard \n\nThis company continues to be one of the top credit card players in the world. MasterCard Inc. (NYSE: MA) operates the self-described world\u2019s fastest payments processing network, connecting consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments and businesses in more than 210 countries and territories. MasterCard\u2019s products and solutions make everyday commerce activities such as shopping, traveling, running a business and managing finances easier, more secure and more efficient. \n\nWith an analyst meeting set for Wednesday, the Jefferies team believes the setup for the stock going into 2016 looks very promising, especially after the recent sell-offs. They expect the company\u2019s net revenue to grow 11.8% next year, versus 2.2% in 2015. \n\nThe Jefferies price target of $112 is higher than the consensus target of $107.43. Shares closed up nicely on Tuesday at $92.90. \n\nThe Medicines Company \n\nThis stock shot up in late August and could be headed higher. The goal of The Medicines Company (NASDAQ: MDCO) is to be a leading provider of solutions in three areas: serious infectious disease care, acute cardiovascular care and surgery and perioperative care. The company is focused on saving lives, alleviating suffering and contributing to the economics of health care by focusing on 3000 leading acute\/intensive care hospitals worldwide. \n\nThe stock jumped last month when the company announced that an experimental cholesterol drug being co-developed with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals lowered LDL-C or \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol levels by around 83% in a small, early stage study. The drug, ALN-PCSsc, is an injected RNAi therapy designed to block the expression of the enzyme PCSK9, a protein that plays a critical role in regulating circulating levels of bad cholesterol in the blood. \n\nThe Jefferies team notes that t\u2026","title":"Top Jefferies Growth Stock Picks to Buy Now","media-type":"News","source":"MyInforms","published":"2015-09-09T12:22:50Z"}

Former President Bill Clinton is taking a more active role in wife Hillary's presidential campaign, headlining fundraisers to rake in big bucks and at the same time trying to play down the growing controversy surrounding her use of a private email server. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, had been trying to distance herself from her husband's policies, many of which were rejected by liberals and of which the former president has said he now believes he was wrong to approve. \n\nHillary Clinton has tried to brand herself as someone separate from her husband. Her campaign logo is a simple \"Hillary\" in a show of independence. \n\nBut with the questions about email refusing to fade, Hillary Clinton is looking for star power and her husband provides that. Bill Clinton, who left office with an approval rating of 65 percent and whose popularity has continued to grow, is scheduled to headline a fundraiser next month in which participants can give $2,700, the Federal Election Commission limit, for a photo op while adding to Clinton's fundraising war chest, the Detroit News reported. The fundraiser at Bingham Farms, Michigan, also invites people pony up $10,000 to co-host the event. \n\nHillary Clinton is no slouch when it comes to fundraising on her own. So far, she has raised $47.6 million for the election, data from the Center for Responsive Politics show. The vast majority of that money has come from large donors. A total of $38.4 million, or 82 percent, of her total fundraising has come from individuals who have contributed more than $200, the benchmark for big donor contributions. It has been estimated she could spend as much as $1 billion in her attempt to take the White House. \n\nIn national polls, Clinton is ahead of her closest competitor, with 40.5 percent of the vote, compared with unabashed socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, who takes in 25.8 percent, according to polling averages from Real Clear Politics. That\u2019s a sharp drop for the former secretary of state since July, when she polled with mid-60 percent. Things look more drastic in the early nominating states for Clinton. In Iowa, she is just 5.2 percent ahead of Sanders after an extended period of time where the two were more or less tied. In New Hampshire, she trails Sanders, who hails from neighboring Vermont, by 11.6 percent.

In January, the company announced the general availability of high-performance G-Series virtual machines (VMs) for Azure that offered up to 32 virtual CPUs powered by cutting-edge Intel Xeon server processors, 6TB of storage capacity provided by solid-state drives (SSDs) and 448GB of memory. According to Microsoft, enterprise adoption is brisk, with a 50 percent increase in use over the past three months. Now, the Redmond, Wash.-based tech giant and cloud provider is aiming even higher. \"Today, we're excited to announce a variant of G-series, the GS-series, which combines the compute power of G-series with the performance of Premium Storage to create powerful VMs for your most storage- and compute-intensive applications,\" wrote Corey Sanders, partner director of program management at Microsoft Azure, in a Sept. 2 announcement. Still powered by Intel Xeon E5 v3 processors, the new Azure VMs bring Premium Storage support into the mix. \n\nGS-series VMs, which are compatible with both Windows and Linux, \"can have up to 64TB of storage, provide 80,000 IOPS (storage I\/Os per second) and deliver 2,000 [megabytes per second] of storage throughput,\" Sanders said. Microsoft claims that compared to rivals, the new VMs offer more than double the disk throughput and network bandwidth (20G bps). \n\nThe new offering is aimed at large database-driven workloads, Sanders noted. \"Relational databases like SQL Server and mySQL, noSQL databases like MongoDB and data warehouses can all have significant performance gains when run on GS-series,\" he said. Businesses seeking to grow or enhance the performance of their existing applications can use the VMs to trade up. \"You can also use GS-series to significantly scale up the performance of enterprise applications, such as Exchange and Dynamics,\" Sanders added.

James Martin\/CNET \n\nThe new Apple TV could see its shipments rise to 24 million next year from 10 million this year and 6 million last year, analyst Rod Hall said in an investors note released on Thursday. \n\nUnveiled on Wednesday, the next-generation of Apple TV comes packed with several new features and enhancements, including support for the Siri voice assistant, a remote control that responds to your touch, an app store and ways to search for content across a variety of different services, such as Netflix and Hulu. Available in October, the new Apple TV will sell for $149 with 32 gigabytes of storage and $199 with 64GB. \n\nApple TV faces competition from a number of similar services, including Roku, Google (with its Chromecast TV plug-in) and Amazon Fire TV as a way to stream video content. Apple's device also lets you watch videos from the iTunes store on your TV. The Roku 3 is considered by many to be one of the most formidable set-top boxes for streaming as it offers voice search and a headphone jack for private listening. The new Apple TV has voice search and other new features, which should give it a more competitive edge. But will it be enough of an edge? \n\n\"The new Apple TV features the A8 processor found on the iPhone 6,\" Hall said. \"Apple said that the new product provides 1080-pixel resolution, which should be adequate given low 4K TV penetration. We do, however, expect Apple to drop the A9 chip (a more powerful chip used in the new iPhone 6S and 6S Plus) sometime in the next 12 months to provide a 4K option. In addition, Apple announced a new remote control with motion sensors and support for console-style Bluetooth game controllers. With these new hardware capabilities and an app store we expect the revenue potential of the Apple TV to expand substantially.\" \n\nHall said he expects total shipments to be split 60:40 between the 32GB and 64GB versions of Apple TV. He also sees the bulk of Apple TV shipments coming to North America and Europe due to the greater availability of content in these regions versus the rest of the world. \n\n\"The new Apple TV focuses on an improved interface including voice with Siri as well as a touch screen remote,\" Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said in an investors note late Wednesday. \"We believe the company significantly improved control and discovery via the new interface, which should yield a better user experience.\" \n\nThough Munster said he believes the new Apple TV is unlikely to meaningfully contribute to\u2026","title":"Apple TV shipments to more than double next year, analyst predicts","media-type":"News","source":"MyInforms","published":"2015-09-10T16:26:49Z"}

You\u2019re fully entitled to hold your opponent to account, to focus on their record, focus on what they\u2019ve done, focus on their promises,\u201d he said noting the ton of the negative campaign is very important. \n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be hysterical, it shouldn\u2019t be personal, it just needs to be clear and contrasting, but more and more you need a positive narrative, and certainly candidates should overwhelmingly only ever communicate a positive narrative,\u201d Mr. Crosby said. \n\nMr. Crosby explained that in general, the candidate should \u201ccarry the positive messages\u201d about who they are and what they want to achieve, and if the campaign wants to go negative, it needs \u201csurrogates\u201d to do it for them. For example, he said, in the U.S., Barack Obama had other people and organizations to attack Mitt Romney about his wealth and past decisions while Mr. Obama focused on the positive campaign. \n\n\u201cBut overwhelmingly, in my view, the balance should be strongly positive. And when you focus on your opponent you want to focus on the negative consequences of them or their policies to your audience,\u201d he said. \n\n\u201cYou may be wanting to highlight the fact that they\u2019ve taken some extreme positions in the past, which make them a risk, or when they\u2019ve been in charge in the past taxes have gone up or the buses have never run on time, or whatever it is. It\u2019s fair that you point to that, you\u2019ve got to focus on your opponent as well as yourself,\u201d he said. \n\nHis strategy could reflect that in Mr. Harper\u2019s stump speech comments about Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau. Mr. Harper has generally referred to Mr. Trudeau as \u201cJustin.\u201d Conservative Party ads that are negative toward Mr. Trudeau\u2019s past statements, a poorly delivered joke about Canadian CF-18 air strikes in Iraq is one example, are also relatively gentle. \n\nMr. Harper is harsher on Mr. Mulcair, but to the point of stridency expressed in Conservative videos, all of which are in French and aimed at the large audience of Quebec voters who switched in droves to the NDP in 2011. \n\nOne of the ads focuses on a controversial allegation a former mayor of Laval, Que., once put an envelope of cash in front of Mr. Mulcair, suggesting a bribery attempt when Mr. Mulcair was a Quebec Liberal MNA and the other focuses on a defamation suit against Mr. Mulcair, also when he was a Liberal MNA. \n\nThose Conservative ads were posted only over this past week. It was the NDP that took the first attack-ad shot in the war between the two parties, just as the federal election was underway, which focused on criminal charges against Conservative Senators and former Conservative MP Dean Del Mastro\u2019s conviction and brief incarceration for Canada Elections Act violations. \n\ntnaumetz@hilltimes.com \n\nThe Hill Times Lynton Crosby's comments made at U.K.-based Patchwork Foundation last year seem to confirm the claim by a Conservative spokesperson that the party has been employing Mr. Crosby\u2019s foreign talent since well before Stephen Harper\u2019s campaign manager suddenly departed the leader\u2019s national tour for the Ottawa war room. \n\nPARLIAMENT HILL\u2014The newly revealed brains behind Prime Minister Stephen Harper\u2019s general election campaign, Australian political backroomer Lynton Crosby, believes it is the \u201ctone\u201d of negative campaigning that is important as well as the content of the attack. \n\nMr. Crosby has also disclosed, in an hour-long seminar with would-be political activists in the United Kingdom last year, that it is the political party, not the candidate or leader, who should \u201cexecute\u201d the negative campaign while the candidate stays above the fray. \n\nThe comments Mr. Crosby made at Patchwork Foundation last year seem to confirm the claim by Conservative Party of Canada spokesperson Kory Teneycke that the Conservative Party has been employing Mr. Crosby\u2019s foreign talent since well before Mr. Harper\u2019s campaign manager, Jenni Byrne, suddenly departed the Conservative leader\u2019s national tour for the Ottawa war room. \n\nThe main points Mr. Crosby outlined to the seminar of visible minority youth at the seminar put on by the Patchwork Foundation\u2014an elite charity whose aim is promoting the integration of \u201cdeprived and minority communities into British political society\u201d\u2014mirror almost perfectly the strategies Mr. Harper and the Conservative Party have implemented at least since last March. \n\nAmong other things, he emphasized campaign preparation, which Mr. Harper and his party have been busy with at least since last November, and arguably since the end of the 2011 general election. \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t fatten a pig on market day,\u201d Mr. Crosby told his young listeners, all sitting around a table in the 2014 seminar that is still available on YouTube. \n\nWatch the video here: \n\nMr. Crosby noted that although the pig fattening quotation has been attributed to him in Australia, it actually was first made by former Australian Liberal Prime Minister John Howard, a Conservative and friend of Mr. Harper\u2019s whose party has long had ties with Canada\u2019s Conservative Party. \n\n\u201cIt takes time to build a relationship with voters,\u201d Mr. Crosby sai\u2026","title":"New Harper strategist Crosby speaks about negative campaigning, election prep","media-type":"News","source":"MyInforms","published":"2015-09-11T21:21:11Z"}

So if I slur it's your fault,\" he said. \n\nBarely recognizable after having been given the Irish-American gangster's severely receding hairline, sallow Celtic complexion and piercing blue eyes, Depp features in almost every scene of Scott Cooper's movie. \n\nIt is a biopic that could almost be classed as a buddy movie since at its core is the relationship between Bulger and John Connolly, a childhood friend from the tough, Irish-dominated area of South Boston, who has become an FBI agent. \n\nConnolly persuades his bosses that he can bring down the Italian mafia in the city, if they offer Bulger a degree of protection as an incentive to help provide the leads and evidence they need. \n\nThe Faustian pact initially yields rewards, allowing Connolly's career to blossom in parallel with Bulger's development of an empire that grows to eventually include illicit gambling, extortion rackets and much of the city's drug trade. \n\nBut as it becomes clear that Connolly has little, if any, control of his supposed informant, Bulger's eventual downfall becomes only a matter of time. \n\nThe film ends with Connolly's arrest on charges which eventually lead to him being jailed for life for corruption and for knowingly causing the death of one of Bulger's many victims. \n\nBulger became a fugitive in 1994 and evaded capture for 17 years. For much of that time he was classed as second only to Osama bin Laden as the US' most wanted man. \n\nHe was finally captured in 2011. Two years later he was convicted of involvement in 11 murders and sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison, where he turned 86 on Thursday. \n\nA complex character \n\nCooper's account spares viewers the worst incidents of extraordinary brutality that punctuated Bulger's criminal career while still providing ample testimony of the sociopathic, sadistic core of his personality. \n\nIn one scene culled from real life, he strangles a friend's girlfriend to death in front of him after discovering she knew more than she should about their affairs. \n\nBut the Bulger portrayed by Cooper is also a man bestowed with a natural charisma who lets his elderly mother cheat at cards - a world away from the Bulger-based monster played by Jack Nicholson in Martin Scorsese's The Departed. \n\nWithout overlaboring the point, the film includes a reference to the fact that Bulger had taken LSD repeatedly for experiments conducted during an earlier stint in prison. \n\nIt\u2026","title":"Depp wows crowd","media-type":"News","source":"MyInforms","published":"2015-09-05T09:58:14Z"}

This will require quantum repeaters, in much the same way that optical amplifiers are required for the transmission of digital data through optical fibers. However, these quantum repeaters will work only if all the single photons that they receive have the exact same wavelength. A team of researchers at universities in Switzerland, Germany, and France reported on 8 September in Nature Communications that they\u2019ve developed quantum dots that can produce streams of photons with identical wavelengths. \n\nTo create the photons, the researchers used self-assembled indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) quantum dots embedded in gallium arsenide. Each quantum dot, although it consists of about a hundred thousand atoms, traps a single electron that can occupy two energy levels. By illuminating the quantum dot with laser light, the electron is moved into the higher energy state. When the electron drops down to its lower energy level, it emits a single photon whose wavelength is determined by the difference in the energy of the two levels. \u201cIn many ways it behaves like a single atom, and this is why it is often called an 'artificial atom,\u2019\u201d says Andreas Kuhlmann a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Basel who was the paper\u2019s lead author. \u201cBut because it is inside a semiconductor it is quite robust, and that is, of course, nice if you want at one point to develop a product. \n\n\u201d \n\nStill, unlike a single atom, the atoms in the quantum dot are an unruly bunch. The fluctuating nuclear spins of the atoms in the quantum dot interact with the electron spin, and fluctuating electric fields created by electrons hopping around cause the two energy levels of the quantum dot to wobble. This results in the emission of photons with wavelengths that vary, if ever so slightly. \u201cIn order to get indistinguishable single photons, which all have exactly the same color, we needed to find a way to suppress the noise,\u201d explains Kuhlmann. \n\nHow did they do it? They cooled the quantum dot to 4.2 Kelvin. They could reduce the noise even further by cooling it even more, an option that is not that attractive. Despite what one might think at first blush, \u201c4.2 Kelvin is in some ways quite warm; at some point you want to develop a product, and it makes sense to stay as warm as possible,\u201d says Kuhlmann. \n\nThat wasn\u2019t the only trick they employed to reduce the noise, says Kuhlmann. \u201cThe samples are grown layer by layer using molecular beam epitaxy, and when you grow these samples you will get some defects.\u201d Crucial to limiting noise, he says, is limiting these defects because they become populated by electric charges that fluctuate. \u201cIt is extremely important that you have high-quality material and that the people who grow these samples know what they are doing,\u201d says Kuhlmann. \n\nThe researchers overcame several hurdles. Though nuclear spins are an intrinsic property of the InGaAs semiconductor, the researchers found a way to reduce the influence of the nuclear spins. Because of its indirect band gap, it can\u2019t emit photons when irradiated by light, explains Kuhlm\u2026","title":"Researchers Create Quantum Dots that Transmit Identical Single Photons","media-type":"News","source":"MyInforms","published":"2015-09-11T20:22:34Z"}

Especially the Honey Nut variety (my favorite \n\n!). \n\nIt also gave me the encouragement to make something that I have pining for these kind of sweet dessert cereal bars for maybe close to a year. It has been on my list of \"to make\" and I just haven't gotten to it. Probably mostly for lack of GF cereals to do it with. \n\nI remember my mom making something like this when I was young and when I looked up the old Betty Crocker recipe, I knew that I had to improve upon it. I added honey roasted peanuts to go with the peanut butter and added brown sugar, kosher salt and a chocolaty peanuty topping that takes these little crispy, chewy, sweet and salty bars to the next level. Make these for school snacks, tailgating parties, or just because you really, really need them. \n\nIngredients \n\n6 cups Honey Nut Cheerios cereal (I used gluten-free) \n\n1 cup plus 1\/4 cup honey roasted peanuts, chopped and separated \n\n1 cup corn syrup \n\n1 cup packed brown sugar \n\n1 1\/4 cups peanut butter \n\n2 teaspoons vanilla \n\n1\/2 teaspoon salt \n\n1 1\/4 cups chocolate chips \n\nSpray a 9\u00d713 baking dish with cooking spray. \n\nIn a\u2026","title":"Treat Yourself to This Gluten-Free Honey Roasted Peanut Chocolate Cheerios Bar","media-type":"News","source":"MyInforms","published":"2015-09-16T12:12:59Z"}

But the event could reveal more about the company\u2019s strategy and its aspirations to be an indispensable part of daily life. \n\n\u201cApple\u2019s master plan is to be ubiquitous,\u201d said Jordan Edelson of software firm Appetizer Mobile, explaining why Apple is increasingly designing its iPhone and Siri to interact with cars, televisions and \u201csmart\u201d home systems. \n\nIt isn\u2019t a sure bet: Apple rivals like Google, Samsung and Microsoft are building their own technology for Internet-connected cars and homes. \n\nWhile the company has been coy, here\u2019s what analysts and others expect at Apple\u2019s event Wednesday in San Francisco: \n\nApple sold a record 183 million iPhones in the nine months since releasing the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, which have bigger screens than earlier models. That has allowed the company to remain highly profitable, even as Samsung and other phone makers struggle. \n\nBased on the iPhone\u2019s usual two-year product cycle, industry experts expect this year\u2019s iPhone 6S models will be the same size with more subtle refinements, such as a faster processor, higher-resolution cameras and new exterior colours. \n\nA crew works outside the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium as preparations continue for the Apple new product announcements. (Source: AP) \n\nOne likely addition to the iPhone 6S is \u201cForce Touch,\u201d which uses screen sensors to discern between a light tap and extended finger pressure to trigger different functions. This arrived on Apple\u2019s smartwatch and some laptops this spring. \n\nSome analysts question whether these features will inspire the same type of consumer demand that propelled last year\u2019s iPhone success story. But research firm Kantar Worldpanel says a substantial number of iPhone owners are still using older, smaller models, which makes them likely candidates to upgrade. \n\nAPPLE TV \n\nApple is expected to unveil a redesigned Apple TV set-top box with new capabilities for apps and games, plus recognition of Siri voice commands to search for shows and retrieve weather forecasts and sports scores. The current model is a few years old and does little beyond playing video and music. \n\nAnalysts say the new TV box is part of Apple\u2019s broader strategy to carve out a bigger role in the home. For instance, the new Apple TV could serve as a hub for Siri to control lamps, thermostats and other \u201csmart\u201d appliances, using Apple\u2019s HomeKit technology. \n\nIt could also set the stage for Apple to later introduce a streaming video service aimed at competing with Netflix and other Internet entertainment services. \n\nSMARTER SIRI \n\nEven without an Apple TV, new iPhone software will make it easier to set up automated homes, including having lights turn on and window shades go up when you tell Siri on the phone, \u201cTime to wake up. \n\n\u201d \n\nWith the new software for iPhones and iPads, Siri can also offer recommendations, such as nearby restaurants, before you even ask.

That\u2019s not my thing. \n\n\u201d \n\nShe said she had fallen in love with Kye and they had built a beautiful relationship over two years. \n\nBut she added: \u201cThese two years have been a fabrication.

The woman replied that she had been naive and needy but had wholeheartedly believed Kye was who he claimed to be. \n\nThe student said she was befriended by Kye while at the University of Chester in 2011, telling police his Facebook profile was utterly convincing, with multiple friends and photographs showing a \u201chalf-Filipino, half-Latino\u201d man. \n\nKye told her he could not meet up due to his extreme anxiety and his need for constant treatment for a tumour that doctors discovered following a road accident. \n\nInstead they spoke on the telephone for hours, and she told police she fell in love, with the suggestion of an engagement. She also became close to fellow student Newland, who claimed to be Kye\u2019s lifelong friend. \n\nIf the alleged victim, who said she had few friends at university, fell out with either Newland or Kye the other would try to persuade her to give it another chance. \n\nAfter repeated requests from the woman, Newland, masquerading as Kye, agreed to meet\u2026","title":"Bizarre blindfold sex case in UK court","media-type":"News","source":"MyInforms","published":"2015-09-09T11:48:35Z"}

Very casual, very elegant.\" \n\nJen arrives and Cait immediately takes her to the closet, where Jen approves of everything she sees and remarks that Caitlyn has \"a bit of a hippie\" in her. \n\n\"I like just kind of blending in,\" the former Olympian says, only to be reminded by Jen that that ship sailed long ago. \n\nAfter all, high heels put Cait \"around 6-foot-9.\" Still, never fear: Her \"level of skill\" in stilettos is \"professional,\" she explains to Jen, who's likely thinking about her client's million-mile walk onto the ESPYs stage. Caitlyn notes that she's been wearing heels for a very long time. \n\nJen doesn't have to worry about a red-carpet look, however, because Caitlyn will parachute in during a commercial break and flee out the back door immediately after her speech. \n\n\"I don't want to be out there in the media where they're asking me stupid questions,\" Caitlyn says, scoring points for outing the majority of all red-carpet questions as, well, stupid. Which they are. \n\n\"All they'll have is that image on stage ... I can control my message.\" Jen is on board with limiting what the media has to \"work with.\" \n\nIndefatigable assistant Ronda Kamihira has something more difficult to work with, however, and that's how Caitlyn sees herself at the country club. Because weeks into her transition, Caitlyn still sees her golf self as Bruce, at least when it comes to signing up for the par-three course that will carry Sherwood Country Club's through nine months of construction on the main links. And Ronda's the one who gets to wrangle the paperwork. \n\n\"At Sherwood, we're still doing the ol' Bruce thing,\" Caitlyn informs her minion. The membership, she says, is under the name Bruce. \n\n\"I don't understand why you're putting Bruce down as opposed to Caitlyn,\" Ronda prods. \"I mean, really? ... Why can't you go in fresh as Caitlyn? What are you going to do, wear your hoodie, and pretend you're not ...? Are you doing to wear a skirt?\" Ronda is not giving up, because Caitlyn is being fairly ridiculous. \n\nWhat it comes down to is that Caitlyn's not ready to deal with it all -- which pretty much means the locker-room situation. She hisses through clenched teeth: \"Let's just put Bruce down, it's fine.\" The rest will come later. After all, tomorrow is another day. \n\nOr maybe not -- because pal Candis Cayne ain't buying what Caitlyn's selling. Forget the conservative nature of the club, forget the ladies in their 70s and 80s who might not want a trans woman in their locker room. \"You can't play both sides of the fence anymore,\" Candis says. \"You're way beyond that. Come on. There's no excuse. Just sign your name as Caitlyn from now on and move on.\" \n\nYup, Cait -- Bruce is gone. That happened. \n\nThe 65-year-old then gets a lesson in legal name and gender changes from the mouths of babes, or at least the mouths of tweens and teens. Chandi Moore, never shy to call Caitlyn out on her crap, leads a group of trans kids who have struggled with lives where their legal identity doesn't always match their public presentation. \n\nTraffic stops, in particular, can go sideways. \"I get all those messed-up questions,\" Ethan explains. \"Like, you don't need to know what I have underneath my clothes.\" Another teen shares an incident where officers started asking how much her wig and implants had cost, and whether she'd had bottom-half surgery or not. \n\nSuddenly, freaking out the folks at the country club falls into perspective for Caitlyn. \n\nBut Holly, a member of the youth group, has a positive message for the \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" veteran. \n\n\"I just want to say thank you so much for the work you're doing. It's reaching a lot of people. I never thought that in a million years that my father would reach out to me, and he sent me an email a few days ago and he told me he wants to get to know me as Holly, and that's such a big deal to me,\" she says. \"Thank you so much. I never thought it would happen.\" \n\nThe \"few days ago\" Holly references would have been right around the time \"I Am Cait\" fired up on TV. A bit later, the year-plus legal process to change a person's name and gender marker in California will be explained to the star of the show, who will decide it's time to get that ball rolling toward the \"golden ticket\" identifying her as her new self. \n\nKudos received from Chandi's gang, Caitlyn is back to freaking out about her ESPYs speech, which will be five to six minutes long and, she says, the most difficult thing she's ever done. The kids are one board, for the most part, and she's rallying her sisters and her mom to attend, even though the \"ornery old gal\" has gone and broken her hip. How dare she! Caitlyn will be devastated if Esther can't make the trip. \n\nBut Esther does make the trip! What a gal! And her wheelchair comes dangerously close to running over her newest daughter's pedicure as she crosses the threshold! So many firsts! Caitlyn's sisters are noticeably less tense than they were in the first episode of the series, and everyone's invited to the ESPYs \n\n! \n\nEveryone except, well, Kris Jenner. She doesn't call, she doesn't write, she doesn't answer Caitlyn's calls ... and Caitlyn didn't invite her. \n\nCue yet another tease to the Big Kris Meeting that we can only pray actually happens before the series runs out of episodes. We have memorized every wrinkle in the ruching of the pale-blue body-conscious dress Caitlyn will be wearing when she opens her front door and meets her ex for the first time in this new presentation. \n\nThen reality (TV) intrudes, and it's time for a dinner party at Geoffrey's in Malibu, where the Miso Braised Tofu costs five bucks more after dark than it does at lunch but Esther's misplaced pronouns cost her only a teasing reprimand from Candis as the trans girls meet the family. It goes swimmingly. And yes, 89-year-old Mom can't help but call Caitlyn \"Bruce.\" Old habits and all that \n\n... \n\nThe next day, Caitlyn slings her crossbody bag into place and heads out for the awards show in her normal position, reclining sideways across the back seat of an SUV to hide from the paparazzi. \"This is quite comfortable,\" she says. \"Got my little pillow.\" \n\nCait's not the only one who's dolling it up for the ESPYs: Chandi and Candis are enjoying the red carpet, with Chandi in a special gown designed by Candis' costumer. They have a moment, where Chandi is overwhelmed that someone would do something nice for her. Caitlyn, of course, simply makes do with Versace, send over by Donatella herself. \n\nThe images from the ESPYs are familiar -- Caitlyn a tower in white onstage, voice cracking as she says she was most afraid of hurting her family, with shots of the Kardashian and Jenner kids, and of course Diane Sawyer -- but the behind-the-scenes insight is fresh. \n\n\"I'm standing there, all Caitlyn, totally out,\" she says in an after-the-fact interview. \"I feel so unbelievably vulnerable.\" (Which is touching, actually.) \n\nAnd poof, the ESPYs are over.

This paradigm of German high finance has been through the regulatory wringer, forced to suffer the wrath of the SEC and Department of Justice over a number of sticky\/questionable financial deals. They shelled out some $55 million to settle a case brought by the SEC in a derivatives inquiry; hunkered down as allegations flew like shells from a German 88 accusing the bank of hiding 12 billion in losses and paid out a whopping $2.5 billion to settle charges of Libor rate-rigging . Current inquiries, reportedly, are targeting the bank's use of so-called \"dark pool\" trading and possible money laundering in Russia. \n\nCries of \"Ach du lieber Himmel\" must resonate through the halls at head office in Frankfurt with each new revelation. \n\nWhile other mega-banks have suffered the slings and arrows of regulatory retaliation there's something unique about Deutsche's problems and for me it's personal. I was born in Lubeck in Deutschland's north a few years after the war. Both my late parents spent time in Camp Auschwitz (much of my family was exterminated) so when I hear anything with the prefix \"Deutsche\" I get all jittery. Brain flashes of storm troopers marching to the marital strains of Deutschland \u00fcber alles suddenly appear and it's not a pretty picture (I grew up hearing about all this stuff from those who were there, on the receiving end). \n\nNot too long ago I stumbled upon two New York Times articles, dated August 1, 1998 and Feb. 5th, 1999, which surfaced the fact that Deutsche Bank had profited by Hitler's murderous adventurism. As Stuka dive bombers rained terror down on Polish cities and the full weight of the Nazi blitzkrieg was crushing any resistance the German banking community was plotting and planning how to take advantage of any newly acquired spoils of war. Jews in the occupied areas of Poland were closing out accounts and fleeing with assets so it became a race against time to move in and stake a claim. This was a gold rush, literally, and Deutsche wasn't the only one taking part. Arch-competitor Dresdner also had financial malice on their corporate mind and for both banks this included trading in gold bullion re-cast from wedding rings, tooth fillings and other property seized from Jews destined for death camp gas chambers. \n\nThis grim but fascinating bit of Holocaust history remains largely unknown to the general public and even among Holocaust historians there seems to be a distinct lack of knowledge (two Holocaust specialists I queried didn't know much of the story). It was up to a team of historians -- ironically, brought together by Deutsche Bank -- to begin the process of rock-kicking. One of the investigators, Princeton University Professor, Harold James, did some commanding research in the mid-1990s and later compiled his findings in a 2004 book, The Nazi Dictatorship and the Deutsche Bank. It's a fascinating read and one that demonstrates that the devil is in the details and given the Nazi penchant for record-keeping the details of banking transactions were preserved with Teutonic passion. \n\nWhile written in somewhat of a dry academic style, The Nazi Dictatorship and the Deutsche Bank, highlights some stories that are downright tragicomic. For instance when Deutsche and Dresdner decided to open up major branch offices in the newly occupied Polish town of Lodz competition grew so keen and cutthroat that Deutsche's bankers complained to the Reich Economics Ministry that Dresdner was seducing local industrialists -- some presumably Deutsche customers -- by hosting a \"beer party with food\" at the local Grand Hotel. \n\nBTW: The Lodz reference struck a resonant chord given my late father -- a teenager in Lodz -- was confined to the notorious ghetto established by the Nazis. My grandfather, who owned a small construction company, died in the ghetto and his assets, I imagine, were spirited away by German bankers.

Many of them will join the thousands of Afghans, Syrians, Iraqis and other migrants seeking a new life in Germany and other European nations. \n\nHundreds of Afghans jam into a government bank on Wednesday, Sept. 16, 2015, to pay the equivalent of $120 for a new passport.

Most of those lining up are from the capital, but many people from surrounding villages are also applying. Officials say 7,000 new passports are issued daily across the country. \n\nAfghans are now the second-largest contingent of migrants heading for Europe, after Syrians but ahead of Iraqis fleeing from the murderous Islamic State jihadis in the Middle East, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and the European Union\u2019s statistical agency. \n\nBut exact numbers are difficult to come by because many of the Afghans heading east have already been living as refugees outside Afghanistan\u2019s borders. A good proportion of those traveling to Europe live in Iran, where some 900,000 Afghans have resided since the 1990s. \n\nLike the Syrians, Iraqis and others, the vast majority of Afghans are hoping to reach Germany, which many describe as a \u201cpromised land\u201d where those escaping wars and poverty are welcome. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had enough; things will never improve here,\u201d said Sameer Dawoudi, a Kabul taxi driver who has been studying German with his family. \u201cI want to become a good German and lead a normal life. \n\n\u201d \n\nGermany.

Now, with thousands of desperate refugees arriving each day, even Germany has started imposing border controls. \n\nThe exodus from Afghanistan has escalated so much in recent months that government officials have complained about the \u201cbrain drain\u201d due to the loss of so many educated young people.

The weed typically begins releasing pollen with warm days and cool nights in August and can last into November. \n\n\"Warmth can extend the growing season for plants that produce ragweed pollen,\" AccuWeather Meteorologist Ben Noll said. \"Late-summer and early fall warmth has enhanced pollen levels across portions of the Plains, Midwest and Northeast.\" \n\nThe Northeast, in particular, may have an extended season as dry conditions allow ragweed pollens to linger. \n\n\"Any pollen that's in the air now is not going to get washed out,\" AccuWeather Meteorologist Alan Reppert said. \n\nAdditionally, milder weather is forecast for the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Southeast, so lower-than-usual chances for freezes could also help to extend the ragweed season. \n\n\"Meanwhile, some mid- and late-September cool snaps across the Plains and Midwest could result in a freeze, killing weeds and bringing an end to the ragweed season,\" Noll said. \n\nThough ragweed allergies typically calm down into late October with the arrival cooler air, allergy-aggravating mold spores can linger later into the season. Mold spores thrive on damp fall foliage. \n\nAcross the Plains, a wetter-than-normal fall could lead to increased levels of these allergens. \n\nEnhanced levels of mold spores could also be an issue across the Southeast in the late fall as the second half of the season appears wetter than the first, Noll said. \n\nUltimately, however, experts\u2026","title":"Fall allergy outlook: Dry weather may extend ragweed season in US Northeast","media-type":"News","source":"MyInforms","published":"2015-09-14T19:01:09Z"}

The secretary of treasury (Jacob Lew) has been in direct negotiations,\" Kissinger said. \"My impression is that progress is being made and I hope this is going to be one of the results (of Xi's visit).\" \n\nThe 92-year-old diplomat, who enjoys high esteem for his career achievements in foreign affairs, shared his wisdom on how Washington and Beijing could better handle their differences on issues such as cybersecurity and the South China Sea \n\n. \n\n\"On the issue of cybersecurity, it is just totally a new issue in the history of nations,\" he said, adding that neither the United States nor China has real experience in the issue or has found a way to negotiate about that. \n\n\"It is a profound problem in which we have to understand first mutually to educate ourselves about what the problem is and then maybe see what we can do about it,\" he noted. \n\nRecently, tensions surrounding the South China Sea caused a number of hiccups in bilateral ties, prompting many to view the issue as a very tricky one. But Kissinger is optimistic that the two countries could in the end find a way to fix it. \n\n\"I think I have now seen Sino-American relations in its ... 45 years. And we have occasionally come up against problems,\" he said. \"... On the South China Sea, my opinion is that we should deal with it as a pragmatic problem not as a philosophical one and try to solve individual issue.\" \n\n\"For example, Americans are concerned about freedom of navigation. China does not object to freedom of navigation. So it is conceivable to me that we will come to some agreement on this to separate the territorial issue from the freedom of navigation issue and then deal with other issues step by step,\" Kissinger said. \n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has said that China has the same concern as other countries over freedom of navigation in the South China Sea and that China is willing to work with other parties in maintaining freedom of navigation and flyover in the area. \n\nAs a trailblazer for U.S.-China ties whose clandestine, ice-breaking visit to China in 1971 paved the way for the establishment of diplomatic relations, Kissinger witnessed the impressive changes China has undergone over the past decades. \n\n\"I have actually seen the progress of China, and I have seen more China than anyone below 50 in China, so I know what the Chinese people can do,\" he said. \n\nRecalling his contact with Xi, Kissinger said: \"I had very good fortune of meeting President Xi when he was (party) secretary in Shanghai and when he was vice president (of China). And now I've met him several times in his capacity as president.\" \n\n\"He is a man of great philosophical depth, who reflects on problems in an overall way,\" he said. \n\nEditor's note: \n\nLater this month, Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to pay his first state visit to the United States since he took office in 2013.

The United States also appeared to join the fray, carrying out an airstrike in Kunduz province. \n\nAs the world watches, the embattled Afghan government can't afford to let the Taliban hang on to a key population center. \n\nHere are the main reasons why the fall of Kunduz is a big deal: \n\nIt's the biggest Taliban victory since 2001 \n\nA U.S.-led coalition helped local Afghan forces drive the Taliban out of Kabul, the capital, in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001. But stamping out the Taliban across the rest of the country proved to be an elusive goal. \n\nThe militants no longer held sway in the main cities but remained a deadly foe, clashing with foreign troops over Afghanistan's rugged terrain and launching frequent suicide attacks in population centers. After 13 years and the deaths of thousands of its service members, the international coalition ended its combat mission last year, leaving Afghan forces at the forefront of the fight. \n\nThe loss of Kunduz, even if the Afghan government manages to take it back soon, is an ominous sign. It's Afghanistan's fifth largest city and the capital of the province of the same name. \n\n\"This is the biggest town they've been able to take since 2001,\" said Nic Robertson, CNN's international diplomatic editor. \"This is a significant target and prize for the Taliban.\" \n\nIt highlights the weakness of Afghanistan's NATO-trained forces \n\nThe U.S. government has tried to portray the handover of combat duties to Afghan troops as a step forward. \n\n\"Instead of Americans patrolling the valleys of Afghanistan, we've trained their security forces, who've now taken the lead,\" President Barack Obama said in his State of the Union address in January. \n\nBut analysts have expressed concern about issues like corruption, poor recruitment and problematic coordination among the different branches of the Afghan security forces: the army, police and local militias. \n\nThe Taliban's intent to try to take Kunduz was well flagged, and yet Afghan forces were unable to hold the city despite outnumbering the attackers. \"Since about April this year, the Taliban increased their strength in the countryside to the north of Kunduz and have essentially had it in their sights since then,\" Robertson said. \n\nIt complicates the next move for the U.S. \n\nThe fall of Kunduz comes at an awkward time for U.S. officials as they debate what kind of military presence they want to have in Afghanistan in the coming years. Gen. John Campbell, the top commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, is due to testify before a U.S. Senate committee about the situation in Afghanistan next week. \n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last week that Campbell had sent five different proposals to the Pentagon and NATO officials on what to do with the roughly 10,000 U.S. troops currently in the country, most of whom are there to train, advise and assist Afghan security forces. \n\nThe recommendations range from keeping U.S. troops at their current level or sticking to the current plan to cut them dramatically to a small force by the end of next year, the report said. In a fresh indication of the Afghans' continued reliance on American backup, the U.S. military said it carried out an airstrike in Kunduz province on Tuesday. \n\nIt shows the Taliban remain a force to be reckoned with \n\nThe militant group hasn't had the easiest year. ISIS has been reported to be eating into its recruitment efforts in Afghanistan, and internal divisions\u2026","title":"Is war against Taliban lost?","media-type":"News","source":"MyInforms","published":"2015-09-29T14:57:38Z"}

Yes. The gridiron? No. \n\nA defensive player on a Texas high school team runs at full speed and blindsides a referee from the back during the waning moments of a game. Seconds later, as the stunned referee is prone on the ground, a fellow teammate spears the official with his helmet. \n\nThe young players, a sophomore and a senior on the John Jay High School Mustangs team in San Antonio, are summarily kicked out of the game and suspended indefinitely. School district officials weigh expulsion and a permanent ban from high school sports. The prosecutor in the county where the game was played is contemplating criminal charges. The young men's actions are excoriated in the public and the news media. \n\nAnd then more details gradually surface because, as ever, some things are not as clear cut as black and white. \n\nApparently, the referee is alleged to have aimed racial slurs at some of the players on the team, which is predominantly Latino and black, and made questionable calls against it. Through a lawyer, the referee has denied the allegations. \n\nThis week, ESPN's \"Outside The Lines\" show revealed that an assistant coach admitted he ordered the players and others to \"pay back\" the referee for the alleged statements and for making questionable calls against them. \n\nThe assistant coach resigned this week. The two players, who have no history of violence or law breaking, will be allowed to return to the school, possibly as early as Jan. 15, after a stint at an alternative school. \n\nThe two players accept responsibility for their actions, said a lawyer hired by their parents. \"They had a choice. They made a choice, and it was the wrong one.\" \n\nHigh school league officials are still exploring potential disciplinary action against the school's football program, including forfeit of the remainder of its games. The referee, who reportedly suffers from post-concussion syndrome, has also retained a lawyer, so I suspect civil litigation is a possibility. \n\nWhat a mess. \n\nCharles Adams, like perhaps every high school football coach in America, has seen the video and followed the events. A veteran Minneapolis cop, Adams has served as head coach of the Minneapolis North High School Polars since 2009. He won coach of the year honors last year in Class 1A football. \n\nHis roots run deep in the inner city school and the neighborhood. Not only did he grow up in the area, but he, his parents and other relatives attended and graduated from North. \n\nOn occasion Adams' team plays against predominantly white suburban schools in his class category or, as he more diplomatically described it to me, \"we go into communities that are different from us. \n\nMitch Carmody, of Hastings, whose pent up grief following the untimely death of his 9-year old son in 1987 led to his calling as a sought after grief facilitator and speaker, photographed Thursday, September 24, 2015.

The 32-year-old and her husband Andrew, parents of two-year-old Thomas, were excited to learn they were expecting baby number two. But during a routine ultrasound at Salford Royal Hospital to determine her due date, Urhegyi was told that the baby had no heartbeat and had died. \n\nDevastated, she weighed the options given to her: let the miscarriage happen naturally, take an abortion pill, or have a D&C abortion to remove the baby from her uterus. She and Andrew chose to use the abortion pill. \n\nAfter two days, Urhegyi was to return for a second pill. She was experiencing heavy bleeding when she went back to the hospital to get it. While she was there, a second ultrasound was performed. That\u2019s when a miracle happened. \n\nThe technician found a heartbeat. \n\nUrhegyi and her husband were ecstatic that their baby was still alive, but then the fear and remorse set in. Doctors told them that there may have been a twin who had been either miscarried or killed by the abortion pill. In addition, there was no way to know if their baby, a girl, would have any health problems as a result of the abortion drug. \n\n\u201cTo say this has ruined my pregnancy would be an understatement,\u201d Urhegyi told the Daily Mail. \u201cOur little girl is a much-wanted baby and we are extremely worried she won\u2019t now be born healthy. We are incredibly angry and upset. We can\u2019t understand how doctors could have made such a big error. \n\n\u201d \n\nBut this error is actually more common than anyone would think. In 2010, two other mothers shared their stories of being told their preborn babies had died when they were actually still alive. In 2014, a woman in Ireland was told her baby had died and she scheduled an appointment for a D&C procedure. Thankfully, her doctor decided to do one more scan and they found that the baby was very much alive. \n\nIn 2011, the Daily Mail reported that each year hundreds of women are wrongly told that they have miscarried their babies because of errors during ultrasounds. Some of them wait to miscarry naturally while others take the abortion pill or have a D&C. How many of those preborn children were actually still alive and growing when their grieving mothers were given an abortion? \n\nWhile they are concerned their daughter may have been harmed by the abortion drug, the Urhegyis are very lucky that their daughter survived the abortion attempt. \n\n\u201cI just wish I had asked for another scan to check, especially as I\u2019d had no other sign anything was amiss with the pregnancy, but then I trusted the doctors. They\u2019ve given me leaflets which explain the drug can be linked to birth defects. Some of these might not be immediately noticeable and will only show as our daughter grows,\u201d said Urhegyi. \u201cBut there\u2019s been hardly any research. I\u2019ve been reassured she is growing as expected and I feel happier now I can feel her kicking. But doctors can\u2019t check for everything. \n\n\u201d \n\nThe hospital has apologized to the couple and launched an investigation into how the error occurred as well as how they can prevent it from happening again. \n\nReprinted with Live Action News \n\n. \n\nWASHINGTON, D.C., September 10, 2015 (LifeSiteNews) - Everything you've been told about defunding Planned Parenthood is wrong, according to Sen. Rand Paul. \n\nCongressional Republican leaders and the mainstream media present the task of cutting off the abortion agency's funding as nearly impossible. But it could be done with one simple procedural maneuver, says the Kentucky Republican presidential candidate, who unveiled his plan at the D.C. pro-life event, \"Women Betrayed: The Real Stories Rally and Lobby Day.\" \n\nPundits say Republicans must produce 60 votes to overcome a Democratic filibuster to defund Planned Parenthood -- two-thirds of Congress to override President Obama's inevitable veto. \n\n\"That gets it exactly wrong,\" Sen. Paul told attendees. \"You need 60 votes to affirmatively fund Planned Parenthood. So, don't accept the notion that we have to get to 60. The other side has to get to 60.\" \n\n\"They do not have 60 votes to fund Planned Parenthood as long as we separate the bills,\" he said. \n\n\"I think the country is coming in our direction. What we need is leadership in Washington. And we should demand nothing less than a separate vote\" requiring Democrats to fund Planned Parenthood in a stand-alone bill. \n\n\"There has never been a better time. These horrific videos are making the country rethink this\" issue, he said. \n\nThen, if the government fails to be funded, the blame will rest with the president and Congressional Democrats, he said. \n\n\"If the Democrats want to shut down government...over spending money for harvesting organs from babies, so be it,\" Sen. Paul said. \"I, for one, will take a stand. I have never voted for any funds for Planned Parenthood, and I never will.\" \n\nSarah Palin, the former governor and vice presidential candidate, who said she asked to attend at the last minute just because she wanted to \"crash your party.\" \n\nPalin made an effort to \"thank Sen. Rand Paul, because he's leading the charge\" to see that binding measures are taken to deprive the abortion industry of its half-billion dollar annual subsidy. \n\n\"We just spoke a little bit ago about how nonsensical it is that there's even a fight about this on Capitol Hill,\" Palin said. \"Our tax dollars should not be going to such atrocities.\" \n\nThanks in part to undercover investigations like those being carried out by the Center for Medical Progress and Lila Rose - who was in attendance - \"more people consider themselves pro-life than ever before.\" \n\n\"The will of the people is for respect for life to be made manifest,\" Palin said. \n\nCritics say that Planned Parenthood funding is not a line item. Instead the funds are embedded in numerous agencies, all of which would have to have their legislation revised in order to deprive Planned Parenthood of all federal funds. \n\nHowever, since all spending bills must originate in the Republican-controlled House, Congressmen could introduce bills that allocate no funds for Planned Parenthood and force Democrats to try to amend the bills. \n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said such a task will have to wait until the nation elects a pro-life president. \n\nBut Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-KS, replied that the last time Republicans controlled all three branches of government, under President George W. Bush, they failed to accomplish that goal. \n\n\"We had six years. They had six years,\" Huelskamp said. But both parties allocated monies for Planned Parenthood \"every year.\" \"The blame,\" he said, \"is on those who say they're pro-life\" but do not vote their convictions. \n\nGrassroots pro-life l\u2026","title":"Doctors said her baby had miscarried, and gave her an abortion pill.

It turns out New Zealanders are not a nation of irresponsible orangutans after all. We\u2019re thoroughly decent people who know\u2026 \r \nFree Press \n\nACT\u2019s regular bulletin \n\nNew Zealanders Watch Rugby at Pub \u2013 World Keeps Turning \n\nThe first few games have been watched in pubs across the country. It turns out New Zealanders are not a nation of irresponsible orangutans after all. We\u2019re thoroughly decent people who know how to enjoy ourselves, then go to work. The only thing that should be banned is the All Black\u2019s wobbly start against Argentina. \n\nLast Day for Red Peak \n\nFree Press has campaigned for Red Peak to be included in the ballot. With 69 per cent of New Zealanders opposed to change upon seeing the options, the Prime Minister\u2019s project needs a circuit breaker. The legislation says the final four flags must be identified 60 days before the referendum period begins, and it\u2019s supposed to start on November 20. The PM should sub one of the options that\u2019s created zero enthusiasm off, and sub Red Peak on. \n\nWhat if he Doesn\u2019t? \n\nWe don\u2019t know if Red Peak could save the process but if nothing else changes the current flag will win easily. Then for every real or imagined problem, people will ask; what\u2019s the PM been doing lately? Then there\u2019s the cost. It is a red herring but it gets attention. The Government spends $26 million every three hours and it is 989,880 hours since we last changed the flag. Nonetheless people are intensely focused on this particular $26 million. \n\nWhat Red Peak Represents \n\nThe National Party has tried and failed to present the Red Peak story as an anti-John Key left wing conspiracy. It\u2019s not. Red Peak\u2019s designer works for one of New Zealand\u2019s most prominent cloud based tech companies (Xero) and its main champion is the Founding Chairman of another (Vend). These tech entrepreneurs are hardly reds under the bed. \n\nMore Support for Partnership Schools Kura Hourua \n\nSir Toby Curtis of the Iwi Leaders\u2019 Forum writes \u201cAt a recent Iwi Chairs Forum hosted by Waikato Tainui at Hopuhopu, iwi leaders resolved to actively support the establishment of partnership schools (kura hourua) in their rohe. We also resolved to advocate that the Government expand this initiative and to advocate the concept publicly, in particular the importance of high-quality teaching, high educational achievement and strong supportive partnerships with iwi, communities and other organisations.\u201d Every month there is less and less question that ACT\u2019s Partnership Schools Kura Hourua are a valuable and respected policy. \n\nStevenson Group Should be Compensated \n\nUnder the Public Works Act the government can commandeer your property for a public purpose but it must compensate you. The principle is that the public benefit so the public pay, not just the property owner. The requirement to compensate is an important check on governments trampling property rights. By blocking Stevenson Group from selling Lochinver Station, the government has trampled property rights and should compensate. \n\nWhat Public Interest? \n\nIt is not clear what public interest we are concerned about. We have an immigration department to decide if people can come here. Foreign Investment is when people stay where they are and send money. The best of all worlds, some might say. What about the land? We don\u2019t believe the Chinese can take it home. What about security? Free Press follows Bastiat\u2019s warning that free trade and investment are the best path to peace: \u201cif goods don\u2019t cross borders, soldiers will. \n\n\u201d \n\nHow Much Compensation? \n\nThe next best deal on offer was $68 million from a local buyer, so Don Brash suggests Stevenson should receive the $20 million difference. That is not a bad starting point. Then there is the question of delay. Much of the difficulty with bad regulation is actually the time lost and Stevenson Group have lost 14 months waiting for an adverse decision. Free Press does not know how to value such a delay but clearly it is costly, for example a 10 per cent return on capital would suggest around $10m. \n\nProperty Rights and The Rule of Law \n\nNew Zealand is a society based on property rights. We avoid many disputes with a rule that children can understand: you can\u2019t touch that, it\u2019s mine. Without clear property rights, chaos (and environmental neglect) ensue. The rule of law is the opposite of the rule of men. The government cannot simply jerk people around, it is subject to the law.

While living and teaching in Korea, not a day went by that we didn't have coffee in some form. It is the most pervasive in instant form. Little tubes the size of a pencil are filled with powdered instant coffee, sugar and creamer. They're then poured into tiny Dixie cups filled with hot water and served at nearly every social junction. It is common to be handed a cup of piping hot instant coffee while waiting at cell phone shops, after a meal, when entering a shop or during a meeting. This hits the very heart of Korean coffee culture. Coffee itself is secondary to the experience. It is the social aspect of the drink that is first and foremost in the mind. \n\nOne of the many aspects of Korean coffee culture that stands out to the foreign visitor is the overwhelming amount of themed cafes. The theme could be something subtle, like a Parisian vibe, or something so glaringly obvious that it paws you in the face \u2014 a cat caf\u00e9 for example. However, the last six years have seen a boom in the roasting and artisanal coffee culture in Korea. The Americano is now on the rise with the popularity of coffee-themed dramas on TV and a younger generation with a taste for caffeine. \n\nKorean cafes can be inelegantly jammed into three major categories: themed cafes, major chains and serious indie shops. It is difficult to make any real broad strokes with Korean shops because the very nature of the country is mercurial. There is such a reliance upon small independent shops and businesses that a coffee shop may appear and disappear in the span of a month. There are, however, some constants. While the dynamic nature of Korea is inherently (against) round-ups, here are a few of the coffee shop names you should know. \n\nARTISANAL \n\nCafe Libre is a small coffee shop, barely able to hold more than 10 sitting customers, but clearly marked with a luchador mask as the logo. Here, coffee is king. The menu only has three options: espresso shots, Americanos and caf\u00e9 lattes. The shop is a former apothecary and still bears the telltale marks of its past. A line typically snakes out the door as Caf\u00e9 Libre is Seoul's predominate roaster. As Korean interest in coffee culture ramps up to an extreme, Caf\u00e9 Libre has risen to the challenge. They source all of their beans and roast each as a single source, meaning the barista won't grind or press your beans until you place your order. The shop also hosts cupping sessions once a week for the up-and-coming aficionado. 121-240 252-15 Yeonnam-dong, Mapo-gu, Seoul, South Korea \n\nCoffee Seed is a barista training facility and roaster that had the claim-to-fame of being the home of the \"Americoke.\" Essentially, this drink \u2014 that plays off of the surge in popularity of the Americano \u2014 is a shot of espresso topped with seltzer and mixed with a secret homemade powder. With a chill vibe and helpful staff, this coffee shop is a great place to explore your tastes and see if there is a new variety of bean you might be in to. \n\nCaf\u00e9 I Do fulfills all of our coffee passions and hipster needs in a single deft blow. The lead barista, Spike, custom makes each coffee based on the customer's mood and the weather. Spike trained as a barista in Italy and returned to Korea to share his passion and artistry. Disposing with the menu, he can decipher your taste after a quick conversation and then brew a cup for your tasting pleasure. The staff uses two separate blends, one for espresso shots and another for milk-based coffee drinks. Take in the muted wood atmosphere as you explore the passion of coffee culture with each sip. 1F, 410-10, Hapjeong-dong, Mapo-gu, Seoul, South Korea \n\nAnthracite Coffee Roasters is a repurposed industrial space. Formerly a shoe factory, this large open area packs in several roasters, a cozy seating space, and a venue for young artists to display their work. It is the exploration of the old with a vision for the new that lends drive to the roasters at Anthracite. They are in a constant quest to find new varietals and blend a strong cup of coffee with a well-balanced flavor. The owners prefer beans that shine with tropical and bright flavors when roasted. 357-6 Hapjeong-dong, Mapogu, Seoul, South Korea \n\n5 Extracts is a wildly popular artisan roaster and coffee shop established by Korea's 2011 barista champion, Choi Hyun Sun. The shop claims its name from the five elements that are required to create the perfect cup of coffee: acidity, aroma, bitterness, body and sweetness. The staff play around with rich cream flavors and both bitter and sweet orange flavors to create award-winning cups of coffee. Seogyo-dong 405-10, Seoul, South Korea \n\nCHAINS \n\nCaffe Bene is one of the finer cafes in Korea and is starting to make an appearance in the USA, too. With all the charm of a rare book shop, a cascade of exposed bulbs casting a soft glow of light, and a conscious effort to make innovative and health-forward drinks, this caf\u00e9 is one of the most popular in Korea. It's not uncommon to encounter small bands of Korean high school students feverishly studying for final exams in a Caffe Bene. \n\nAngel-in-Us is one of the more glitzy cafes one can find in Korea. With its gold-heavy angelic theme and rich drinks, this is a popular spot for couples and stay-at-home mothers to tune out the troubles of the day over a designer cup of coffee. Korea doesn't have the same infatuation with skinny soy lattes that we do here in the USA, so most coffee drinks are mocha-inspired and made with breve (aka half and half) or whole milk. One of our personal favorites is the seasonal strawberry mocha at Angel-in-Us, topped with real bits of freeze dried strawberries. \n\nAnother very popular chain that is growing in availability and reputation is Holly's Coffee. \n\nTHEMED \n\nMay Island takes theme to the extreme.

Reyes hopes for near-full use of the hand he almost lost after a freak accident earlier this summer while he was changing a tire. \n\n\"It's a funny feeling,\" he said in an interview while his hand was still attached to his belly. \"Anything to get me well.\" \n\nSurgeries like this \u2014 temporarily attaching one body part to another, or tucking it under skin \u2014 are by no means new, but they are uncommon. They are used on the battlefield, in trauma situations, and increasingly in research as a way to incubate lab-grown body parts from scaffold-like materials. \n\nDr. Anthony Echo, plastic surgeon at Houston Methodist, thought of it when he saw Reyes, a retired cattle ranch worker and school bus driver who lives in Missouri City, Texas. \n\nReyes was home alone one day in late June, changing a tire on a trailer, when the jack slipped, pinning his hand against a fender. It was more than 100 degrees that afternoon, and it took half an hour for help to arrive. \n\nThe hot metal was like an iron and \"just cooked his hand,\" burning through a thick glove and through skin, tendons and tissue, Echo said. Doctors initially tried a conservative approach, cleaning and bandaging the wound, but infection set it and most of his index finger had to be amputated. \n\nStill, the hand grew worse. \n\n\"His skin was almost completely dead,\" his granddaughter said doctors told her. \"They said it looked like mummy skin.\" \n\nReyes was sent to Echo, who realized a skin graft or flap of tissue from another part of Reyes' body would not work. The damage was down to the bone, and without a good blood supply, a graft or flap would die, he explained. \n\nEcho decided to try tucking the hand inside Reyes' belly. \n\n\"The abdominal skin actually sticks to the hand\" and new blood vessels form to connect them, he said. Without this, \"likely he would have lost all of his fingers,\" Echo said. \n\nWhen he explained it to the family, \"I thought it was more or less something out of a sci-fi movie.

But the details of what happens on a hot surface as water boils have been poorly understood, so unexpected hotspots can sometimes melt expensive equipment and disable\u2026 \r \nPostdoc Navdeep Singh Dhillon (pictured) studies the fundamental physical mechanisms that dictate the boiling crisis phenomenon. At right is a rig for measuring the critical heat flux (CHF) of thermally saturated water boiling on thin textured substrates, which allows researchers to visualize bubbles and measure real-time spatial substrate temperatures using infrared imaging. \n\nThe boiling of water is at the heart of many industrial processes, from the operation of electric power plants to chemical processing and desalination. But the details of what happens on a hot surface as water boils have been poorly understood, so unexpected hotspots can sometimes melt expensive equipment and disable plants. \n\nNow researchers at MIT have developed an understanding of what causes this extreme heating\u2014which occurs when a value known as the critical heat flux (CHF) is exceeded\u2014and how to prevent it. The new insights could make it possible to operate power plants at higher temperatures and thus significantly higher overall efficiency, they say. \n\nThe findings are reported this week in the journal Nature Communications, in a paper co-authored by mechanical engineering postdoc Navdeep Singh Dhillon, professor of nuclear science and engineering Jacopo Buongiorno, and associate professor of mechanical engineering Kripa Varanasi. \n\n\"Roughly 85 percent of the worldwide installed base of electricity relies on steam power generators, and in the U.S. it's 90 percent,\" Varanasi says. \"If you're able to improve the boiling process that produces this steam, you can improve the overall power plant efficiency \n\n.\" \n\nThe bubbles of vapor that characterize boiling, familiar to anyone who has ever boiled water on a stove, turn out to limit energy efficiency. That's because gas\u2014whether it's air or water vapor\u2014is highly insulating, whereas water is a good absorber of heat. So on a hot surface, the more area that is covered with bubbles, the less efficient the transfer of heat energy becomes. \n\nThe textured boiling samples used for CHF measurements are silicon substrates \u2014 5-centimeters squared and 650 microns thick \u2014 patterned with a thin-film heater on the back. Pictured here is one such silicon substrate (black) held in the boiling rig sample holder. \n\nIf those bubbles persist too long at a given spot, it can significantly increase the temperature of the metal underneath, since heat is not transferred away fast enough, Varanasi says\u2014and can potentially melt part of the metal. \n\n\"This will most certainly damage an industrial boiler, a potentially catastrophic scenario for a nuclear power plant or a chemical processing unit,\" says Dhillon. When a layer of bubbles limits heat transfer, \"locally, the temperature can increase by several thousand degrees\"\u2014a phenomenon known as a \"boiling crisis.\" \n\nTo avoid exceeding the CHF, power plants are usually operated at temperatures lower than they otherwise could, limiting their efficiency and power output. Using textured surfaces has been known to help, but it has not been known why, or what the optimal texturing might be. \n\nContrary to prevailing views, the new work shows that more texturing is not always better. The MIT team's experiments, which use simultaneous high-speed optical and infrared imaging of the boiling process, show a maximum benefit at a certain level of surface texturing; understanding exactly where this maximum value lies and the physics behind it is key to improving boiler systems, the team says. \n\n\"What was really missing was an understanding of the specific mechanism that textured surfaces would provide,\" Buongiorno says. The new research points to the importance of a balance between capillary forces and viscous forces in the liquid. \n\nMIT researchers use infrared imaging to study what happens as water boils on surfaces. \n\n\"As the bubble begins to depart the surface, the surrounding liquid needs to rewet the surface before the temperature of the hot dry spot underneath th\u2026","title":"Analysis of textured surfaces could lead to more efficient, less dangerous power plants","media-type":"News","source":"MyInforms","published":"2015-09-08T12:35:49Z"}

The New Mexico State University assistant professor always expected her mother to develop it, like her grandmother before her, so she knew she wanted to contribute to research that would help fight the disease that kills more than 40,000 women in the U.S. every year. \n\nYou won't find her working with cells in a biology lab, though. Her weapon against cancer is statistical analysis - and she played a key role in the development of an online tool that allows women and their physicians to more accurately assess their risk and make informed decisions about preventative health care. \n\nGard is a biostatistician who teaches in the Department of Economics, Applied Statistics and International Business in NMSU's College of Business. She also works as a consultant with the National Cancer Institute-funded Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. As a result of that work with a team of researchers from the University of California-San Francisco, UC-Davis, Group Health Research Institute and the Mayo Clinic, the consortium has rolled out an updated online breast cancer risk calculator, which can estimate five- and 10-year invasive breast cancer risk based on a woman's age, race and ethnicity, family history, breast biopsy history and breast density. \n\n\"Our tool is unique in that it combines both breast density and biopsy results,\" Gard explained. \"It's the only risk assessment tool that includes BI-RADS breast density, which is the breast density that's used in clinical practice.\" BI-RADS stands for the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System of the American College of Radiology. \n\nWhen a woman has a mammogram, Gard said, her radiologist will assign a breast density measure of \"a,\" \"b,\" \"c\" or \"d,\" where \"a\" indicates mostly fatty tissue and \"d\" indicates extremely dense tissue. Numerous studies that have shown that women who have dense breasts are at higher risk for developing breast cancer. \n\nBy including this breast density information along with benign biopsy results, the calculator helps paint a clearer picture of a woman's risk compared to other women of her age, race and ethnicity. \n\nCurrently, 24 states require that women undergoing mammography who have breast density \"c\" or \"d\" be notified of their breast density. New Mexico is not among them, Gard said, but federal legislation to make that a nationwide requirement is under consideration. This means more women will be receiving information about breast density in their mammography reports and talking with their doctors about how density impacts their risk. \n\n\"We're hoping that having this tool available will be helpful to physicians and women when these discussions start taking place,\" Gard said. \n\nNew Mexico Department of Health spokesman David Morgan said any new tool that may help doctors and patients evaluate risk is a welcome addition. \n\n\"Every person should be armed with as much information as possible when they make decisions - with their doctors - about their health care,\" Morgan said. \n\nThe breast cancer risk calculator is available at https:\/\/tools.bcsc-scc.org\/BC5yearRisk.
